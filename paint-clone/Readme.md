## Built with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript

### Something like :

### Just kidding it is a simple app with functionality such as :

- Brush
- Background Color
- Eraser
- Save to Local Storage
- Save image to desktop
- load from local storage,
- clear local storage

### It show which tool is active. Either the brush or the eraser.And it also shows us some info when we click on one of these other buttons so far to click save to local storage.

### I've also added a custom color input called JSColor to make sure that it looks the same regardless of browser or operating system.
